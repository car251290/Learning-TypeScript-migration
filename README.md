Learning how to migrate 
Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing 
TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

The type system in TypeScript has different levels of strictness when working with a codebase:

A type-system based only on inference with JavaScript code
Incremental typing in JavaScript via JSDoc
Using // @ts-check in a JavaScript file
##TypeScript code
TypeScript with strict enabled
Each step represents a move towards a safer type-system, but not every project needs that level of verification.

## TypeScript with JavaScript
This is when you use an editor which uses TypeScript to provide tooling like auto-complete, jump to symbol and refactoring tools like rename. The homepage has a list of editors which have TypeScript plugins.

## How to switch my code from JS to JTS
If you have a lot of JavaScript files you want to add errors to then you can switch to using a jsconfig.json. You can skip checking some files by adding a // @ts-nocheck comment to files.

TypeScript may offer you errors which you disagree with, in those cases you can ignore errors on specific lines by adding // @ts-ignore or // @ts-expect-error on the preceding line.
## Properties are inferred from assignments in class bodies
ES2015 does not have a means for declaring properties on classes. Properties are dynamically assigned, just like object literals.

In a .js file, the compiler infers properties from property assignments inside the class body. The type of a property is the type given in the constructor, unless itâ€™s not defined there, or the type in the constructor is undefined or null. In that case, the type is the union of the types of all the right-hand values in these assignments. Properties defined in the constructor are always assumed to exist, whereas ones defined just in methods, getters, or setters are considered optional.

class Type {
  constructor() {
    this.constructorOnly = 0;
    this.constructorUnknown = undefined;
  }
  method() {
    this.constructorOnly = false;
    // the boolean if the false or true
Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number'.
Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number'.
    this.constructorUnknown = "plunkbat"; 
    this.methodOnly = "ok"; 
  }
  method2() {
  //Boleean true
    this.methodOnly = true; 
  }
